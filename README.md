## Pure Time and Randomness

This repository contains some code examples that demonstrate how the concepts of time and
randomness can be handled in a purely functional fashion in Java.
The implementation heavily leverages the RxJava 2 API for abstracting the state-changing
elements of the code in a functional-reactive way.
